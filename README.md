# R-SnowModel

# This R script compiles, runs, and translates the fortran code SNOWMODEL (Liston and Elder, 2006)

# A Distributed Snow-Evolution Modeling System (SnowModel)
# https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM548.1

# To properly run this code, you will need a Fortran compiler and a working version of SNOWMODEL
# I use a MacBook Pro and a version of GFortran

# Fortran gridded data is saved in a GrADS file
# I translante this data using R code from Marcos Longo

# This is my first draft of the readme file, I plan to expand more on the steps to run the program.
