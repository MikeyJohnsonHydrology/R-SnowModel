15 Sep 2005
Base version of MicroMet/SnowModel created.

11 Oct 2005
/met/mk_micromet_input_file.f was modified to run on GNU/Cygwin
compilers by adding 'parameter (maxlines=10000000)' to each
subroutine in the file.

12 Oct 2005
Removed the use of 'snow_d_previous' in in the Tabler surface
calculation in snowtran_code.f.

12 Oct 2005
Added a 'sum_prec' calculation to 'subroutine precip(...) to
correct the 'subroutine waterbal_snowtran(...)' in snowtran_code.f,
for the case where EnBal and SnowPack are not used.

07 Nov 2005
Added a note to docs/topo_veg_input_format.txt describing the
relationship between the "y" order used in the model.

09 Jan 2006
Extracted the extra code that was to be used for the eventual
non-zero conduction implemention.

09 Jan 2006
Added the dimension (nstns_max) to the elev array in the
shortwave_data, longwave_data, and sfc_pressure_data subroutines.

20 Jan 2006
Corrected some compiler warnings related to sum_unload,
sum_d_canopy_int, d_canopy_int in waterbal_snowpack and
waterbal_snowtran, and topo in enbal_code.f, and nx and ny in
barnes_oi_ij.

23 Jan 2006
Corrected a "number of grid cells" error in the document
SnowModel_compile_run.txt.

25 Jan 2006
Modified several aspects of the Tabler-surface reprepsentation in
snowtran_code.f.  See the SnowTran-3D version 2.0 paper; Simulating
Complex Snow Distributions in Windy Environments.  These
modification include the addition of new control parameters in the
snowmodel.par file.

25 Jan 2006
Corrected the setting of Qh and Qe over snow-free land to not do
this over melting, snow-free, glacier surfaces.

01 Feb 2006
Corrected how forest_LAI was sent into subroutine SNOWPACK_CORE.

01 Feb 2006
Added a note in the snowmodel.par file stating that you can run the
following sub-model combinations: (micromet), (micromet, enbal),
(micromet, enbal, snowpack), (micromet, snowtran), or (micromet,
enbal, snowpack, snowtran).

01 Feb 2006
An "i" was added to the begining of the parameter
"precip_lapse_rate_user_flag" in the snowmodel.par file, and
throughout the code, so that it follows the naming convention
stated at the begining of that file.

03 Feb 2006
Changed prec_factor_index from a real number to an integer, because
it is used to identify the location within an array.

15 Feb 2006
Added the line "speed(k) = max(windspd_min,speed(k))" to
micromet_code.f because some compilers do not allow v_grid and
u_grid to both be 0.0 in the atan2 computation.

03 May 2006
Made numerous changes to the Tabler drift surface calculations
performed in snowtran_code.f.

10 May 2006
Removed the variable 'snow_d_previous' from the code.

10 May 2006
Removed the old subgrid_1 subroutine and replaced it with old
subgrid_2 (tabler surfaces).  Old subgrid_2 was renamed subgrid_1.
Subgrid_flag = 2.0 is no longer an option.

23 May 2006
Implemented the Utau_t evolution submodel.

07 Jun 2006
Implemented the precipitation and melt data assimilation model.
This included replacing variable 14 "sum_d_canopy_int" in the
snowpack.gdat output file with a "sum_swemelt" variable.

17 Jul 2006
Passed "icorr_factor_loop" from snowmodel_main.f to outputs_user.f.

19 Aug 2006
Modified the deltax and deltay test in the tabler routines to
handle the "test" test for the case of linux compiler that produced
a machine precision error in the calculation.

22 Aug 2006
Added a test to see whether nx_max and ny_max in snowmodel.inc are
large enough to handle the nx and ny simulation domain defined in
snowmodel.par.

22 Aug 2006
Added 'if' statements to subgrid_1 subroutine to prevent i and j
indexing from being less than 1 or greater than nx or ny.

04 Oct 2007
Added the latitudinal weighting to the incoming solar radiation
calculations.  This includes adding a new flag to snowmodel.par.

05 Oct 2007 
Added the ability to print out the eight Tabler equilibrium
surfaces.  You can do this by uncommenting the write statements
following the call to the tabler_3d subroutine in snowtran_code.f.

25 Mar 2009 
Modified the compile script to use the pgf77 compiler and also
allow for output file sizes over 2 Gb (-mcmodel=medium).

25 Mar 2009 
Corrected an error in the glacier melt contribution to runoff
calculation in snowpack_code.f that was producing water balance
errors over glacier areas.

25 Mar 2009 
Corrected an error in the saltation subroutine where xmu*dx/fetch
was greater than 1.0 for the case where dx, dy > 166.67. Also
included a test in preproc_code.f that checks to see whether
SnowTran-3D is being run for grid increments > 250 m, and
sends a warning flag if this is the case. See Eqn. (9) in LS98.

25 Mar 2009 
Commented out the decreased albedo for the case of thin snow cover
in the GET_SFC subroutine in enbal_code.f.

25 Mar 2009 
Changed all occurrances of the ' in Buck's to `, in order to keep
Linux editor colors resonable.

25 Mar 2009 
Changed the format of the 'WORKING ON MODEL TIME' banner in
micromet_code.f

25 Mar 2009 
Implemented a test of whether the maximum number of met stations
defined in snowmodel.inc is exceeded when the stations are counted.
This is done in the get_obs_data subroutine in micromet_code.f.

25 Mar 2009 
Changed how the roughness length is defined for vegetation in the
GET_SFC subroutine in enbal_code.f.

12 May 2009
Added the ability to run the model using GMT time and include a
longitudinal variation in incoming solar radiation for that case.

10 Jun 2009
Added the swesublim, albedo, and vegtype variables to the
outputs_user.f subroutine.

10 Jun 2009
Restricted emiss_cloud to be <= 1.0 in micromet_code.f.

11 Jun 2009
Fixed two errors in the incoming solar radiation calculations for
sloping terrain in the southern hemisphere.

26 Jun 2009
Fixed the date calculation in get_model_time subroutine so that it
still works for huge iter values. This solves a rounding error
problem.

23 Nov 2009
Fixed an error in the nsnowden subroutine.

05 Jan 2010
Added a check to make sure max_iter in snowmodel.par is greater
than max_time_steps in snowmodel.inc.

16 Mar 2010
Changed snowpack.ctl from showing saving variable sumcanopy to
sumswemelt.

16 Mar 2010
Added Qcs = 0.0 for the case of vegtype.gt.5.0 in CANOPY_SNOW.

17 Mar 2010
Modified the code so that the water balances are calculated
considering the budget for the given time step only, instead of
the budget summed from the start of the model run through the
given time step.

05 May 2010
Implemented a history restart function.  See notes in
snowmodel.par.

12 Jul 2010
Changed the scale_ht value from 8500.0 to 8000.0 to be consistent
with Wallace and Hobbs (1977).

16 Jul 2010
Modified the history restart function so that it works for data
assimilation runs.  See notes in snowmodel.par.

31 Oct 2010
Added +1's to the read and write corr_factor loops in the
HRESTART_SAVE_DA and HRESTART_READ_DA subroutines.

31 Oct 2010
Modified in two places how the wind directions are computed from
u,v components in the WIND subroutine.

31 Oct 2010
Added a wind direction averaging calculation in outputs_user.f.

08 Nov 2010
Cleaned up outputs_user.f, including made the unit numbers large
enough so they are not duplicated anywhere else in the code.

08 Nov 2010
Cleaned up dataassim_user.f to be compatible with the above
outputs_user.f changes.  Also corrected the closing of output
files used as part of the data assimilation but written to later.

09 Nov 2010
Add the nobs_dates+1 corr_factor information to the corr_factor
array, so that it is saved and used as part of the history
restart function.

13 Nov 2010
Modified subroutine corr_factor_index in dataassim_user.f to
account for the difference between the print frequency and the
model time step.  There was previously a problem if the model
time step and output frequency was one hour.

10 Mar 2011
Implemented a multi-layer snowpack model.

10 Mar 2011
Implemented the ability to define a date in the .par file that
zeros out the snow cover arrays when that date (month day hour)
is reached.  This can be used to set the snowpack to zero each
summer during multi-year simulations.

15 Jun 2011
Implemented the ability in MicroMet to read in an alternate
wind dataset that has been previously generated with another
program, like winds from NUATMOS.  To do that set the flag to
-1.  See i_wind_flag = -1 in the code for an example of how to
do this.

12 Aug 2011
Added "recommended default" values to each parameter in the
snowmodel.par file.

12 Aug 2011
Added parameter value range checking in readparam_code.f, to
ensure appropriate values are defined in the snowmodel.par file.

08 Sep 2011
Defined land-cover class #24 to be ocean.

08 Sep 2011
The output paths in outputs_user.f were defined to be more
general.

in SNOWPACK_CORE.

10 Jan 2012
Changed the water balance threshold from e-6 to e-5.

10 Dec 2012
Corrected the delta_topo calculation in the get_cloudfrac
subroutine.

12 Dec 2012
Changed how the non-converged warning flag is presented in the
Tsfc calculation in enbal_user.f.

04 Jan 2013
Modified the solar_rad subroutine in micromet_code.f to
appropriately deal with southern latitudes.

22 Jan 2013
Added a snow-albedo evolution code to the GET_SFC subroutine in
enbal_code.f, that can be implemented if someone is interested.

22 Jan 2013
Added a note in the TEMPERATURE subroutine in micromet_code.f
about where to get information about the Mernild and Liston
temperature inversion code and implementation.

05 Feb 2013
Set nz_max=2 in snowmodel.inc to avoid compiler warnings when
compiling with gfortran.

15 Feb 2013
Created an improved version of the Tabler subgrid code, and
updated the discussions in snowmodel.par to reflect these
changes.

15 Feb 2013
Modified the smoother9 subroutine so the corrections are
symetrical.

15 Feb 2013
Cleaned up the compile.snowmodel.script to make it simpler.

17 Jul 2013
Modified the xmin calculation in subroutine get_model_time
so that it runs more time steps before rounding errors cause a
problem with the model time calculation.

01 Nov 2013
Set the erosion distance lower limit to 0.0 instead of 1.0.

13 Nov 2013
Added a "checking met data" printout note before the
"met_data_check" subroutine in preprocess_code.f.

04 Jun 2014
Corrected the SENSIBLE, LATENT, and ENBAL subroutines so that
glacier melt (and glacier runoff) are again calculated.  These
had been wrongly turned off as part of turning off surface-flux
calculations over snow-free grid cells.

22 Jun 2014
Added a check in preprocess_code.f to look for undefined (or
negative) met station elevations.

30 Oct 2014
Added a large-scale curvature array that reduces the threshold
shear stress required to move snow.  This makes it easier for
wind to erode snow off of steep, high, mountain slopes.

07 Jul 2015
renameed snowmodel.vars.inc to be snowmodel_vars.inc.

07 Jul 2015
Added the parameter "check_met_data" to the .par file to allow
the skipping of the met input file data check that makes sure
there is at least one valid value for each time step.

08 Jul 2015
Modified the outputs_user.f file to be more general and more
easily configured by the user.

08 Jul 2015
Added a seaice_run = 0.0, 1.0, or 2.0 flag to the .par file
to control snow-on-sea-ice simulations.

09 Jul 2015
If this is a sea-ice run, flags now prevent the water balances
from being performed.

10 Jul 2015
Added the ability to read in daily sea ice concentration data
and delete the snow information in any grid cell where the
concentration goes to zero.

10 Jul 2015
Cleaned up some mixed-mode "mod()" calculations throughout the
code.

28 Jul 2015
Added "In Assim Loop #X" to the model screen outputs.

06 Aug 2015
Cleaned up dataassim_user.f, including adding the ability to
define a local-area influence for the observation points.

02 Dec 2015
readparam_code.f was modified to make it easier to identify
whether any of the .par variables have not been defined before
the model runs.

24 Feb 2016
Configured the model to run with all of grid cells of interest
concatonated into a single line of grid cells.  This is useful
when large parts of a rectangular domain are not of interest
in your simulation, for example, when you want to simulate snow
processes over all of the glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere
or all of the ice-free grid cells in Greenland.

24 Feb 2016
Changed the maximum grid increment that can be used when running
SnowTran-3D from 250m to 500m.

24 Feb 2016
Added a check in "subroutine met_data_check" to make sure that
the value of nstns that is read in from the met file does not
exceed nstns_max in snowmodel.inc.

07 Mar 2016
For simulations running with data assimilation, the code now
zeros out the arrays "sum_sprec" and "sum_swemelt" in the
ZERO_SNOW subroutine.

07 Mar 2016
The "barnes_lg_domain" flag now has the option of having met
stations that have data that come and go during the model run.
To do this it calculates the nearest "stations" at every time
step.  This allows you to have both (re)analysis and station
data in your simulation.  It's not very efficient, but you can
do it.

10 Mar 2016
Changed the "WORKING ON MODEL TIME" screen printout so that
if it is not an assimilation run it does not print the Assim
Loop Number.

10 Mar 2016
Rewrote the dataassim_user.f subroutine.  This included
changes to snowmodel_main.f, snowmodel.inc, preproc_code.f,
micromet_code.f, and snowmodel.par.

10 Mar 2016
Subroutine outputs_user.f was cleaned up to make the options
clearer.

10 Mar 2016
Ran a "gfortran -Wall fname.f" command for each of the .f files
and cleaned up some small coding issues.

11 Mar 2016
Changed the data assimilation flag name from "irun_corr_factor"
to "irun_data_assim".

05 May 2016
Added a wind_lapse_rate adjustment to MicroMet.  This allows
the user to impose a wind increase with elevation.  See the
notes in the .par file for details.
